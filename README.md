# text_stream cli

A high-speed CLI text pipeline that ingests raw input, calculates structural text metrics, and streams sanitized data directly back to your Windows or macOS system clipboard.

## Features
- Instant Metrics: Tracks word count, sentence count, absolute characters, and reading times.
- Smart Formatting: Normalizes extra tabs, duplicate spaces, and messy line breaks into a clean, uniform single-line string.
- Auto-Clipboard Sync: Modifies your clipboard instantly with the cleaned text using native OS pipelines (clip on Windows / pbcopy on macOS).
- Zero Dependencies: Built entirely with native Python core modules. No pip install required.
